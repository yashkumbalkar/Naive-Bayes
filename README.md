# Bayes' Theorem and Naive Bayes Classifiers

## Overview :-

This project explores **Bayes Theorem** and its application in **Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithms** for text classification, 
specifically focused on sentiment analysis using the **IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset**.

---
## Objective :-

To understand and apply different types of **Naive Bayes classifiers** to perform sentiment analysis (positive/negative) 
on textual movie reviews from the IMDb dataset.

---

### Types of Naive Bayes Used :-
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: For continuous data with normal distribution assumptions.
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: For text classification with frequency counts.
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: For binary or boolean features.
- **Categorical Naive Bayes**: For discrete categorical features.

## üß† What I Learned

- **Bayes Theorem**: A foundational concept in probability and statistics, used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A simple and effective probabilistic classifier based on Bayes Theorem with the "naive" assumption of feature independence.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **IMDb Sentiment Review Dataset**
- Each entry contains a movie review and a sentiment label (positive or negative).

Dataset Source: [IMDb Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)

## üìä Results

- Implemented and compared performance of different Naive Bayes classifiers.
- Achieved good baseline performance with **Multinomial Naive Bayes** for text classification.
- Demonstrated the strengths and appropriate use cases of each Naive Bayes variant.
