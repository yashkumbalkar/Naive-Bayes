# Bayes Theorem and Naive Bayes Classifiers
---
### Overview :-

This project explores **Bayes Theorem** and its application in **Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithms** for text classification, 
specifically focused on sentiment analysis using the **IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset**.

---
### Objective :-

To understand and apply different types of **Naive Bayes classifiers** to perform sentiment analysis (positive/negative) 
on textual movie reviews from the IMDb dataset.

---
### Data Source :-

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:- [IMDB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)

---
### Types of Naive Bayes Used :-
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: For continuous data with normal distribution assumptions.
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: For text classification with frequency counts.
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: For binary or boolean features.
- **Categorical Naive Bayes**: For discrete categorical features.

---
### What I Learned :-

- **Bayes Theorem**: A foundational concept in probability and statistics, used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A simple and effective probabilistic classifier based on Bayes Theorem with the "naive" assumption of feature independence.


---
### Conclusion :-

Naive Bayes classifiers, despite their simplicity, remain effective for many text classification problems. This project serves 
as a reminder that sometimes simple models with good assumptions can outperform more complex ones.
