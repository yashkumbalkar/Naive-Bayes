# Bayes' Theorem and Naive Bayes Classifiers

## Overview :-

This project explores **Bayes Theorem** and its application in **Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithms** for text classification, 
specifically focused on sentiment analysis using the **IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset**.

## Objective :-

To understand and apply different types of **Naive Bayes classifiers** to perform sentiment analysis (positive/negative) 
on textual movie reviews from the IMDb dataset.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Bayes Theorem**: A foundational concept in probability and statistics, used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A simple and effective probabilistic classifier based on Bayes Theorem with the "naive" assumption of feature independence.

### Types of Naive Bayes Used:
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: For continuous input features.
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Well-suited for text data with word counts.
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Works with binary/boolean features (e.g., word presence/absence).
- **Categorical Naive Bayes**: For categorical/discrete features.

## 📂 Dataset

- **IMDb Sentiment Review Dataset**
- Each entry contains a movie review and a sentiment label (positive or negative).

Dataset Source: [IMDb Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
